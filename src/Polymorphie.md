### Question
> Can you explain current Page, why is there a compile error?
> ```java 
> Dog d = new Dog();
> Animal a = d;
> d.doTrick(new Trick());
> a.makeSound();
> a.doTrick(new Trick());  // compile error </code>
> ``` 
> with class Dog has <code>.doTrick(Trick trick)</code> and class Animal has <code>.makeSound()</code>
> and class Dog is childClass from class Animal
### A.I.
> Certainly! The current page is discussing the concept of **Polymorphism** in object-oriented programming, specifically in the context of static and dynamic types. Here's a summary of the key points related to your question:
>
> - **Static vs. Dynamic Types**: The variable `a` is statically typed as `Animal`, which means at compile-time, it is treated as an `Animal`. However, dynamically (at runtime), `a` is actually a `Dog` object because it was instantiated as a `Dog` and then upcast to `Animal`.
>
> - **Method Availability**: The `Animal` class does not have the `doTrick(Trick trick)` method, so when you try to call `a.doTrick(new Trick())`, the compiler throws an error because it checks method availability based on the static type, which is `Animal`.
>
> - **Polymorphism in Action**: The `makeSound()` method works fine because it is defined in the `Animal` class and thus is part of the `Animal` interface. Since `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`, it inherits this method, and the dynamic type's (`Dog`) implementation is used at runtime.
>
> - **Compile Error Reason**: The compile error occurs because the `doTrick(Trick trick)` method is not part of the `Animal` class's interface. To fix this, you would need to either add the method to the `Animal` class or cast `a` to `Dog` before calling the method, like this: `((Dog)a).doTrick(new Trick());`.

### Question
> but shouldn't JVM traverse the class hierarchy from the child class?
>
> so when I declare this:
> ```java 
> Animal a = new Dog();
> a.doTrick(new Trick())
> ``` 
> then JVM will check class Dog first, and if it doesnt find .doTrick() it will go up the hierarchy tree until Object class
> 
> however, .doTrick() is defined in class Dog, so even if it is not in class Animal, it should be fine?
### A.I.
> I understand the confusion, but the way the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles method calls is based on the **static type** of the reference, not the dynamic type. Here's a more detailed explanation:
>
> When you write `Animal a = new Dog();`, you are creating a reference `a` of the static type `Animal` that points to an object of the dynamic type `Dog`. The JVM uses the static type to determine what methods can be called on the reference at compile time.
>
> The `doTrick(Trick trick)` method is not defined in the `Animal` class, so when you try to call `a.doTrick(new Trick())`, the compiler will not allow it because it only looks at the methods available in the `Animal` class, which is the static type of `a`.
>
> The JVM does not "traverse the class hierarchy" at compile time to find methods. It relies on the static type's method declarations. At runtime, the JVM will use the actual object's (dynamic type's) implementations of the methods that are called, but the methods themselves must be part of the static type's interface.
>
> To call `doTrick(Trick trick)` on `a`, you would need to cast `a` to `Dog` because `doTrick(Trick trick)` is only available in the `Dog` class:
>
> ```java
> Animal a = new Dog();
> ((Dog)a).doTrick(new Trick()); // This will compile and run³[3]
> ```
>
> This cast tells the compiler that you are treating `a` as a `Dog` for this particular method call, and since `Dog` has the `doTrick(Trick trick)` method, the code will compile and run correctly. The runtime check will then confirm that `a` is indeed a `Dog` and execute the method.

### Question
> sorry, I will re-sentence my statements:
>
> Given 3 classes with Mammal extends Animal, Dog extends Mammal, then:
>
> First statement:
> 1. At compile time, JVM will start checking on the static type's class for the said method (it will transverse the class hierarchy to check if exist)
>
> example:
> Mammal m = new Dog();
>
> here JVM will check class Mammal for said method then go to class Animal if none found -> if until Object class (root class) not found, then compile error
>
> 2. At runtime, JVM will use the objects Dynamic type (Dog), transversing the hierarchy to find the method (similar to Compile Time)
>
> Dog -> Mammal -> Animal
>
> Second Statement:
> given there exists a method .certainMethod() in Mammal, and .certainMethod() is overwritten in Dog, then in runtime, since JVM starts transversing from Dog Class, it uses the overwritten method
### A.I.
> Let's clarify the two statements:
>
> **First Statement:**
> At compile time, the Java compiler does not traverse the class hierarchy. It only checks the methods available in the static type's class. If you have:
>
> ```java
> Mammal m = new Dog();¹[1]²[2]
> ```
>
> The compiler will check for methods in the `Mammal` class because `m` is statically typed as `Mammal`. It will not go up to `Animal` unless `Mammal` explicitly extends `Animal` and you are calling a method that is defined in `Animal`.
>
> **Second Statement:**
> At runtime, the JVM uses the dynamic type of the object to determine which method implementation to execute. If `Dog` overrides a method from `Mammal`, and you call that method on an object that is dynamically a `Dog`, the JVM will execute the `Dog` class's override.
>
> For example, if `Mammal` has a method `.certainMethod()` and `Dog` overrides it:
>
> ```java
> Mammal m = new Dog();¹[1]²[2]
> m.certainMethod(); // Calls Dog's override at runtime
> ```
>
> Even though `m` is statically typed as `Mammal`, at runtime, the JVM knows that `m` is actually a `Dog` and will call `Dog`'s `.certainMethod()`.
>
> So, to summarize:
> - At compile time, method availability is checked against the static type's class.
> - At runtime, method execution is based on the dynamic type's class and its hierarchy.
>
> Your understanding is correct regarding the runtime behavior. The JVM will execute the overridden method in the dynamic type's class if it exists. If not, it will traverse up the hierarchy until it finds an implementation to execute. This is known as **dynamic method dispatch** and is a key aspect of polymorphism in Java.
### A.I.
> I see where the confusion might be coming from, so let's clarify the process both at compile time and runtime:
>
> **First Statement:**
> 1. At compile time, the Java compiler does **not** traverse the class hierarchy to check for methods. It only checks the methods available in the static type's class. If a method is not found in the static type's class, it results in a compile error. The compiler does not go up the hierarchy to look for methods.
>
>    For example:
>    ```java
>    Mammal m = new Dog();¹[1]²[2]
>    m.doTrick(new Trick()); // Compile error if doTrick is not in Mammal³[3]
>    ```
>    Here, if `doTrick` is not a method in `Mammal`, the compiler will give an error. It will not check `Animal` or any other superclass for the `doTrick` method.
>
> 2. At runtime, the JVM uses the dynamic type of the object to determine which method implementation to execute. However, the method must be part of the static type's interface, or a cast must be used.
>
> **Second Statement:**
> If there is a method `.certainMethod()` in `Mammal` and it is overridden in `Dog`, then at runtime, the JVM will indeed use the overridden method in `Dog` when the dynamic type of the object is `Dog`. This is correct and is an example of polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch.
>
> Here's a correct summary:
> - At compile time, the Java compiler checks the static type's class for the method. If it's not found, it results in a compile error.
> - At runtime, the JVM uses the dynamic type's class to execute the method. If the method is overridden in the dynamic type's class, that implementation is used.
>
> So, the key point is that the compiler does not traverse the class hierarchy at compile time. It strictly checks the static type's class for the method availability. At runtime, the JVM executes the method based on the dynamic type's class, using polymorphism to determine the correct method implementation to run. If the method is overridden in a subclass, that version is executed. If not, it will use the method from the superclass.

### Question
> but your 1st statement about "At compile time, the Java compiler does not traverse the class hierarchy to check for methods." will be weird in this situation:
>
> given Animal has method .method_A();
> Mammal extends Animal but doesnt override the method
> same goes for Dog, it extends Mammal but doesn't override .method_A();
>
> then, when I do this:
> Mammal m = new Dog();
> m.method_A();
>
> in runtime, this should work since JVM will transverse the hierarchy to find .method_M() in class Animal right? But by your definition it doesnt work since class Mammal doesnt has implementation of method .method_A()
### A.I.
> I apologize for any confusion. Let's clarify the situation you've described:
>
> Given:
> - `Animal` has a method `.method_A()`.
> - `Mammal` extends `Animal` but does not override `.method_A()`.
> - `Dog` extends `Mammal` and also does not override `.method_A()`.
>
> When you do this:
> ```java
> Mammal m = new Dog();
> m.method_A();
> ```
>
> Here's what happens:
> - At **compile time**, the Java compiler looks at the static type of `m`, which is `Mammal`. Since `Mammal` is a subclass of `Animal`, and `Animal` has the `.method_A()` method, the compiler will allow this call to compile. It does not need to traverse the hierarchy because `Mammal` inherits `.method_A()` from `Animal`.
>
> - At **runtime**, the JVM uses the dynamic type of `m`, which is `Dog`. Since `Dog` does not override `.method_A()`, the JVM will use the implementation from the nearest superclass where `.method_A()` is defined, which in this case is `Animal`. The JVM will execute `Animal`'s `.method_A()` method.
>
> So, to correct the earlier statements:
> - At compile time, the Java compiler allows the call to `.method_A()` because it is available in the static type's class hierarchy (inherited from `Animal`).
> - At runtime, the JVM executes the method based on the dynamic type's class hierarchy. Since `Dog` does not override `.method_A()`, the method from `Animal` is executed.
>
> Therefore, in your example, `m.method_A();` will work both at compile time and runtime because `Mammal` inherits `.method_A()` from `Animal`, and `Dog` does not provide an override. The method call is valid and will execute the implementation from `Animal`. This is consistent with the principles of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
### Question
> wait, how does JVM knows that Mammal has .method_A() if it doesnt traverse the hierarchy?
>
> the said method is in class Animal, and by the meaning of dynamic method dispatch it will only know which method to execute by traversing
### A.I.
> The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) knows that `Mammal` has `.method_A()` because of the way inheritance works in Java. When a class extends another class, it inherits all the public and protected members (methods and fields) of the superclass. This is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> - **Inheritance**: When `Mammal` extends `Animal`, it inherits all inheritable methods from `Animal`, including `.method_A()`. This means that `.method_A()` becomes part of `Mammal`'s class definition as well.
>
> - **Compile Time**: At compile time, the Java compiler understands inheritance and knows that `Mammal` has access to `.method_A()` because it is defined in `Animal` and `Mammal` is a subclass of `Animal`. The compiler does not need to traverse the hierarchy at this point because the inheritance relationship is clear from the class definitions.
>
> - **Runtime**: At runtime, the JVM uses dynamic method dispatch to determine which method implementation to execute. If `Dog` had overridden `.method_A()`, the JVM would execute `Dog`'s version of the method. Since `Dog` does not override `.method_A()`, the JVM executes the inherited method from `Animal`.
>
> To summarize, the JVM knows that `Mammal` has `.method_A()` because `Mammal` inherits it from `Animal`. The compiler checks for method availability based on the static type's class and its inheritance hierarchy. At runtime, the JVM executes the appropriate method implementation based on the dynamic type's class and its inheritance hierarchy. This process does not require traversing the hierarchy at compile time because the inheritance relationships are already established in the class definitions.

### Question
> so in conclusion, when Mammal inherited Animal, it is similar to this:
>
> given a ball (method or attribute - protected / default / public) in box Animal, it will be copied, creating a new ball, but with same property (name, parameter, content, etc.)
>
> this ball is added inside box Mammal, any overridden method or attribute is like taking the said copy ball and paints it up, and any other new method or attribute is new ball that doesnt exist in box Animal
>
> since JVM Compile Time only check box Mammal, and it has copy of ball in Animal, then it can assure itself that the method/ attribute exists
### A.I.
> Your analogy is quite close to how inheritance works in Java. Let's refine it a bit to match the concepts of Java's object-oriented programming:
>
> - **Inheritance**: When `Mammal` inherits from `Animal`, it's like `Mammal` gets access to a **shared box** of balls (methods and attributes) that belong to `Animal`. Instead of copying, `Mammal` can use all the balls in the `Animal` box because it has a special pass (the `extends` keyword) that allows it to access `Animal`'s box.
>
> - **Overriding**: If `Mammal` decides to change the way a ball (method) behaves, it paints over the original ball with its own colors (implementation). This is overriding a method.
>
> - **New Methods or Attributes**: If `Mammal` wants to add new balls (methods or attributes) that are not in `Animal`'s box, it can do so. These new balls are unique to `Mammal` and are not shared with `Animal`.
>
> - **Compile Time**: At compile time, the Java compiler looks inside the `Mammal` box to check for balls (methods and attributes). Since `Mammal` has access to `Animal`'s box, the compiler knows that all the balls in `Animal`'s box are also accessible through `Mammal`.
>
> - **Runtime**: At runtime, if you have a `Mammal` reference to a `Dog` object, the JVM will use the `Dog` object's box to determine which balls (methods) to use. If `Dog` has painted over a ball (overridden a method), the JVM uses `Dog`'s version. If not, it uses the shared version from `Animal`.
>
> So, in your example:
> ```java
> Mammal m = new Dog();¹[1]²[2]
> m.method_A();
> ```
> - The compiler knows `method_A()` exists because `Mammal` has access to `Animal`'s box.
> - At runtime, the JVM uses the `Dog` object's box to execute `method_A()`. Since `Dog` hasn't painted over the `method_A()` ball (hasn't overridden the method), the JVM uses the shared `method_A()` from `Animal`.
>
> This shared access to methods and attributes through inheritance is what allows Java to be such a powerful and flexible object-oriented language. Your understanding of the process is correct, and your analogy captures the essence of inheritance and method resolution in Java. Well done! 👍
### Question
> wait, to make it more precise:
>
> when overriding = the painted over ball is actually separate from actual ball right? such as ball method_A is in shared box, then a copy of it is created and painted over, and puts in Box Mammal
>
> As for creating new methods/ attributes = new balls is put inside Mammal box
### A.I.
> Yes, your understanding is correct. Let's refine the analogy to match the concepts of Java's object-oriented programming even more precisely:
>
> - **Overriding**: When `Mammal` overrides a method from `Animal`, it's like `Mammal` creates its own version of the ball (method) and paints it with its own colors (implementation). This new ball is placed in `Mammal`'s box and is used instead of the original ball from `Animal` when the method is called on a `Mammal` object or any of its subclasses unless they have their own override.
>
> - **New Methods/Attributes**: When `Mammal` adds new methods or attributes, these are like new balls that are created and placed directly into `Mammal`'s box. These balls are unique to `Mammal` and do not exist in `Animal`'s box.
>
> Here's how it looks in code:
>
> ```java
> class Animal {
>     public void method_A() {
>         // Original behavior
>     }
> }
>
> class Mammal extends Animal {
>     @Override
>     public void method_A() {
>         // Overridden behavior
>     }
>
>     public void newMethod_M() {
>         // New behavior unique to Mammal
>     }
> }
>
> class Dog extends Mammal {
>     // Inherits method_A from Mammal, which is an override of Animal's method_A
>     // Inherits newMethod_M from Mammal
> }
> ```
>
> In this code:
> - `method_A` in `Mammal` is the overridden method, represented by the painted ball in `Mammal`'s box.
> - `newMethod_M` is a new method added to `Mammal`, represented by a new ball in `Mammal`'s box.
> - `Dog` inherits both `method_A` (the painted ball) and `newMethod_M` (the new ball) from `Mammal`.
>
> This analogy helps to visualize the concept of inheritance, method overriding, and adding new methods in Java. Your description is a good representation of these object-oriented principles. 👍

### Question
> To make sure:
>
> in compile time, JVM checks box Mammal and shared box between Mammal and Animal
> in Runtime, JVM checks box Dog and sharedbox between Dog and Mammal, then if none found, it goes up the hierarchy, checking the box Mammal and sharedbox between Mammal and Animal?
### A.I.
> Yes, that's a good way to put it! Let's break it down:
>
> - **Compile Time**: The Java compiler checks the **static type** (the box labeled 'Mammal' in your analogy) and the methods it has access to, which includes methods from its own definition and methods inherited from its superclass (the shared box between 'Mammal' and 'Animal'). If a method is called that doesn't exist in the static type's class or its superclass, the compiler will throw an error.
>
> - **Runtime**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) checks the **dynamic type** (the box labeled 'Dog') when executing a method call. If the method is overridden in 'Dog', it uses that version. If not, it looks up the hierarchy to find the method implementation, checking the 'Mammal' box and then the shared box between 'Mammal' and 'Animal'.
>
> Here's a simplified view:
>
> *Compile Time**:
> ```
> Check 'Mammal' box for method.
> If not found, check shared box between 'Mammal' and 'Animal'.
> If still not found, error.
> ```
>
> **Runtime**:
> ```
> Check 'Dog' box for method.
> If not found, check 'Mammal' box.
> If not found, check shared box between 'Mammal' and 'Animal'.
> Execute the first found method implementation.
> ```
>
> This process ensures that the correct method is called based on the object's actual type at runtime, while also ensuring that the code is safe and sound at compile time. Your understanding of the compile-time and runtime behaviors in Java's object-oriented system is correct! 👍
### Question
> I think your simplified view is not complete:
>
> Runtime:
> ```
> Check 'Dog' box for method.
> If not found, check shared box between 'Dog' and  'Mammal'.
> If not found, check shared box between 'Mammal' and 'Animal'.
> Execute the first found method implementation.
> ```
> since we don't need to check the single 'Mammal' or 'Animal' box because any method/attribute that is not private (the one that can be inherited) will be putted in shared box right?
### A.I.
> You are absolutely correct, and I appreciate your attention to detail. Your revised version of the runtime process is more accurate. Here's the updated view with your corrections:
>
> **Runtime**:
> ```
> Check 'Dog' box for method.
> If not found, check shared box between 'Dog' and 'Mammal'.
> If not found, check shared box between 'Mammal' and 'Animal'.
> Execute the first found method implementation.
> ```
>
> In Java, when a class extends another class, it inherits all the public and protected members (methods and attributes) from its superclass. These inherited members are indeed part of the "shared box" in the hierarchy. Private members are not inherited and are not part of this shared box.
>
> So, during runtime, the JVM will check the dynamic type's class (e.g., 'Dog') for the method. If it's not found, it will proceed to check the inherited methods from its superclass (e.g., 'Mammal'), and so on up the hierarchy until it finds an implementation to execute. This ensures that the most specific implementation available in the hierarchy is used.
>
> Your understanding of the inheritance and method resolution process in Java is spot on. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! 👍

### Question
> Question: what does the statement in page 2 means:
>
> It must be ensured when compiling that an object has the methods/attributes used. This is only possible with the static type, because:
> ```java
> Animal a = makeAnimal("dog");
> Animal b = makeAnimal(userInput);
> a.doTrick(new Trick());
> b.doTrick(new Trick()); // error: Is b a Dog? Who knows!
> ```
> also, shouldn't a.doTrick(new Trick()); also result in error?
### A.I.
> The statement on page 2 is explaining the concept of **static vs. dynamic types** in Java, particularly in the context of method invocation. Here's a summary:
>
> - **Compile-Time Checks**: The compiler must ensure that the object has the methods/attributes that are being called. This check is based on the **static type** of the object.
> - **Static Type**: The static type of `a` and `b` is `Animal`, which is determined at compile time.
> - **Dynamic Type**: The actual object type (dynamic type) that `a` and `b` refer to at runtime could be any subclass of `Animal`, such as `Dog`.
> - **Method Invocation**: The method `doTrick(new Trick())` must be defined in the static type `Animal` for the code to compile. If `doTrick` is not defined in `Animal` but only in `Dog`, then `a.doTrick(new Trick());` would also result in a compile-time error unless `a`'s dynamic type is `Dog` and the method is being called in a context where `a` is known to be a `Dog`.
>
> In summary, the static type determines what methods can be called at compile time, while the dynamic type determines which method implementation is used at runtime. If `doTrick` is not defined in `Animal`, both `a.doTrick(new Trick());` and `b.doTrick(new Trick());` would result in compile-time errors.
### Question
> your statement:
> 
> "then a.doTrick(new Trick()); would also result in a compile-time error unless a’s dynamic type is Dog and the method is being called in a context where a is known to be a Dog."
> 
> can you explain it more throughoutly? particulary the part "the method is being called in a context where a is known to be a Dog."
### A.I.
> Certainly! The statement refers to the concept of **type casting** in Java. Let's break it down:
>
> - **Static Type**: The static type of a variable is the type that is declared at compile time. In your example, both `a` and `b` are declared as `Animal`.
>
> - **Dynamic Type**: The dynamic type is the actual type of the object that the variable refers to at runtime. Even though `a` is declared as `Animal`, it could actually refer to an object of type `Dog` at runtime.
>
> - **Method Availability**: At compile time, the compiler checks if the methods being called are available in the static type. If `doTrick` is not a method in `Animal`, calling `a.doTrick(new Trick());` will result in a compile-time error because the compiler only knows about `a`'s static type, which is `Animal`.
>
> - **Type Casting**: If you know that `a`'s dynamic type is `Dog`, you can tell the compiler this information by casting `a` to `Dog`. This is done in a context where you have the knowledge that `a` is indeed a `Dog`. For example:
>
> ```java
> Animal a = makeAnimal("dog"); // Suppose this returns a Dog object¹[1]
> if (a instanceof Dog) {
>     ((Dog)a).doTrick(new Trick()); // This is the context where 'a' is known to be a 'Dog'⁴[4]
> }
> ```
>
> In the above code:
> - `instanceof` is used to check if `a` is actually a `Dog` at runtime.
> - The cast `((Dog)a)` informs the compiler that you are treating `a` as a `Dog` for the purpose of this method call.
> - Now, the compiler allows the call to `doTrick` because it is available in `Dog`.
>
> The "context where `a` is known to be a `Dog`" refers to situations where you have additional information (such as the result of an `instanceof` check) that tells you `a` is a `Dog`, and you use that information to safely cast `a` to `Dog` before calling `Dog`-specific methods.
>
> Without such a context (i.e., without casting or additional checks), the compiler cannot assume that `a` is a `Dog`, and thus, calling `a.doTrick(new Trick());` would result in a compile-time error if `doTrick` is not a method in `Animal`. This is because the compiler must ensure that the code is safe and will not result in errors at runtime due to calling methods that might not exist on the object `a` refers to.
### Question
> so in the case where dog has a unique method, and we have Animal a = makeAnimal("dog");
>
> we have to check if a is instance of dog, if it is, we can cast it to dog to call the unique method
>
> also other question: do we need to recast <code>a</code> to Animal to reset its condition or does the cast to Dog only applied to the if block?
### A.I.
> In the case where `Dog` has a unique method not present in `Animal`, and you have an `Animal` reference that you believe is actually a `Dog`, you would indeed need to check if the reference is an instance of `Dog` before casting it. Here's how you can do it:
>
> ```java
> Animal a = makeAnimal("dog");
> if (a instanceof Dog) {
>     ((Dog)a).uniqueDogMethod(); // Cast 'a' to 'Dog' to call the unique method
> }
> ```
>
> Regarding your second question, the cast to `Dog` does not permanently change the type of `a`. The cast is temporary and only applies to that specific operation within the block where it's used. After the cast, `a` is still an `Animal` reference, and you can continue using it as such without needing to recast it to `Animal`. The scope of the cast is limited to the expression or block where it's applied.
>
> Here's an example to illustrate this:
>
> ```java
> Animal a = makeAnimal("dog");
>
> // 'a' is still an Animal reference here
> a.makeSound(); // Calls the makeSound method from Animal class
>
> if (a instanceof Dog) {
>     // Temporary cast to Dog within the if block
>     ((Dog)a).uniqueDogMethod(); // Calls the unique method from Dog class
> }
>
> // 'a' is still an Animal reference after the if block
> a.makeSound(); // Calls the makeSound method from Animal class again
> ```
>
> In this example, `a` remains an `Animal` reference throughout the code. The cast to `Dog` is only for the duration of the `((Dog)a).uniqueDogMethod();` call. After that, `a` continues to be treated as an `Animal`. There's no need to "reset" its condition because the original reference type hasn't changed. 👍

### Question
> by the logic of our boxes analogy, if Animal class has a method, and the method is overriden in Mammal, but the overriden method is private, and Dog doesnt overrides the method, the one that should be called is in Animal class right?
### A.I.
> Yes, that's correct. In Java, if a method in a superclass is overridden in a subclass with a **private** access modifier, it effectively becomes a new method that is not visible to any other class, including subclasses of that subclass. Here's how it works with your analogy:
>
> - **Animal Class**: Has a method, let's call it `.method_A()`.
> - **Mammal Class**: Overrides `.method_A()` and makes it private.
> - **Dog Class**: Does not override `.method_A()`.
>
> In this scenario, `Dog` cannot see the private `.method_A()` from `Mammal`, so it has access only to the `.method_A()` from `Animal`. When you create a `Dog` object and call `.method_A()`, the version from `Animal` will be executed because the private method in `Mammal` is not part of `Dog`'s inheritance hierarchy.
>
> Here's an example in code:
>
> ```java
> class Animal {
>     public void method_A() {
>         // Implementation in Animal
>     }
> }
>
> class Mammal extends Animal {
>     private void method_A() {
>         // Private implementation in Mammal

>     public static void main(String[] args) {

> In the `Main` class, when `dog.method_A()` is called, the `Animal` class's `.method_A()` method is executed, not the private one from `Mammal`. This is because private methods are not inherited by subclasses, and `Dog` is considered to have inherited `.method_A()` directly from `Animal`. 👍
### Question
> also, by the "box", Dog has access to shared box between Mammal and Animal
### A.I.
> Exactly! In Java, when a class extends another class, it inherits all the public and protected members of its superclass. This means that `Dog`, as a subclass of `Mammal`, which is in turn a subclass of `Animal`, has access to the public and protected methods and attributes of both `Mammal` and `Animal` (unless they are overridden with a more restrictive access modifier, like private, in a subclass).

> - **Dog Box**: Inherits the contents of the `Mammal` box (which includes the inherited contents from the `Animal` box) and may add or override methods and attributes.

>
> This inheritance hierarchy allows `Dog` to use methods and attributes defined in `Animal` and `Mammal`, as long as they are not private. If `Mammal` has a private method that overrides a method from `Animal`, `Dog` will not have access to that private method and will instead use the method from `Animal`.

### A.I.
> The "box" analogy is a way to visualize the concept of inheritance and method resolution in Java. It's not a literal description of how the JVM operates, but it helps to understand the principles behind it. Let's clarify what happens at compile time and runtime:
>
> **Compile Time**:
> - The Java compiler checks the **static type** of the reference variable to determine what methods can be called.
> - It looks at the methods available in the static type's class and its superclasses (the "shared box" in the analogy).
> - If a method is not found in the static type's class or its superclasses, the compiler throws an error.
> - The compiler does not "traverse" in the sense of dynamically searching; it uses the class hierarchy defined by the `extends` keyword to know which methods are available.
>
> **Runtime**:
> - The JVM uses the **dynamic type** of the object to determine which method implementation to execute.
> - If the method is overridden in the dynamic type's class, that implementation is used.
> - If not, the JVM looks up the hierarchy to find the method implementation, starting from the dynamic type's class and moving up to its superclasses.
> - The first method implementation found is executed.
>
> So, while the analogy suggests a traversal, what actually happens is that the Java compiler and JVM use the class hierarchy as defined in the source code to resolve methods. The "boxes" represent the classes and their relationships, not the process of searching through them.
>
> Your summary of the process is essentially correct, though. At compile time, the compiler ensures that the method exists in the static type's class or its superclasses. At runtime, the JVM executes the appropriate method based on the dynamic type's class and its inheritance hierarchy. The key difference is that this is all determined by the static relationships defined in the code, not by a dynamic traversal process. 👍
### Question
> oh, I think I kinda get it:
>
> we can see traverse the hierarchy as moving from one box to another from lowest level to highest level (box Dog -> shared Mammal -> shared Animal)
>
> and for compile: you can just jump to any box randomly to search for the Method, since you have access to all shared box (box dog -> shared Animal -> shared Mammal), this can also be sped up using parallel search like: (box dog, shared Animal, shared Mammal - all three boxes are searched at same time)
### A.I.
> You've got it! Your understanding of the concept is on point. Let's summarize it with the correct terminology:
>
> - **Traversing the Hierarchy**: This refers to the process of moving through the class hierarchy from the subclass to the superclass, accessing methods and attributes along the way. In your analogy, this is like moving from one box to another, starting from the specific class (like `Dog`) and moving up through its superclasses (`Mammal`, `Animal`).
>
> - **Compile Time**: During compilation, the Java compiler has a complete view of the class hierarchy. It doesn't need to "traverse" or "search" in the same way as at runtime. It knows exactly where each method is because the relationships between classes are defined by the `extends` keyword. The compiler can directly access the methods available in the static type's class and its superclasses.
>
> - **Runtime**: At runtime, the JVM uses the actual object's type (the dynamic type) to execute methods. If a method is overridden in a subclass, that version is used. If not, the JVM looks up the hierarchy to find the appropriate method to execute.
>
> Your analogy of "boxes" and "shared boxes" is a helpful way to visualize the inheritance structure in Java. Just remember that the compiler's "view" of the class hierarchy is based on the static relationships defined in the code, and it doesn't perform a search in the same way as the JVM does at runtime.
>
> Keep in mind that while the analogy helps to understand the concept, the actual implementation in the Java compiler and JVM is based on the class definitions and the bytecode generated during compilation. The "search" is not random or parallel; it's a well-defined process based on the class hierarchy.
